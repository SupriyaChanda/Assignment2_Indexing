ps may I suggest  seriously  that if the doctors and wannabedoctors on
the net who refuse to have an open mind on alternative treatments and
theories such as the yeast theory should create your own moderated group

Why  Is there some reason why you feel that it shouldnt be pointed out
in SCImed that there is no convincing empirical evidence to support the 
existence of systemic yeast syndrome

I dont know the first thing about yeast infections but I am a scientist
No scientist would take your statement  no convincing empirical evidence
to support the existence of systemic yeast syndrome  to tell you
anything except an absence of data on the question  Noring has pointed out
the catch22 that if the crazy theory were true you probably couldnt
find any direct evidence of it  that you couldnt observe those yeastie
beasties with present methods even if they were there  Noring and the
fellow from Oklahoma sorry forgot your name have also suggested one set
of anecdotal evidence in favor based on their personal experiences 
namely that when people with certain conditions are given antifungals
many of them appear to get better  

So if you have any evidence against the hypothesis  for example
controlled doubleblind studies showing that the antifungals dont do any
better than sugar water  then lets hear it  If you dont then what we
have is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side and abject
disbelief on the other  In which case please there is no point in yelling
back and forth at each other any longer since neither side has any
convincing evidence either positive or negative  

And I understand that your abject disbelief is based on the existence of
people who may get famous or make money applying the diagnosis to everything
in sight making wild claims with no evidence and always refusing to do
controlled studies  But that has absolutely no bearing on the apparently
sincere experiences of the people on the net observing antifungals working
on themselves and other people in certain specific cases  There are also
quacks who sell oral superoxide dismutase in spite of the fact that its
completely broken down in the guts but this doesnt change the genuine
scientific knowledge about the role of superoxide dismutase in fighting
oxidative damage  Same thing  Just cause there are candida quacks that
doesnt establish evidence against the candida hypothesis  If theres some
other reason besides the quacks if only anecdotal to think it could be
true then that is what has to be considered that is what the net people
have been talking about

But again there is no point in arguing about it  There is anecdotal
evidence and there is no convincing evidence and there are also some
candida quacks out there I hope everyone can agree on all of that  Thus
it appears to me the main question now is whether the proponents can
marshall enough anecdotal evidence in a convincing and documented enough
manner to make a good case for carrying out a good controlled doubleblind
study of antifungals or else forget convincing anybody else to carry out
the test just carry it out themselves  and also whether they can
adequately define the patient population or symptoms on which such a study
should be carried out to provide a fair test of the hypothesis
