poster for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did 
not exist  Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible Steve and I 
see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well  

Do you believe that any quacks exist  How about quack diagnoses  Is
being a licensed physician enough to guarantee that someone is not
a quack or is it just that even if a licensed physician is a quack
other people shouldnt say so  Can you give an example of a
commonly diagnosed ailment that you think is a quack diagnosis
or have we gotten to the point in civilization where we no longer
need to worry about unscrupulous healers taking advantage of
people

Sure there are quacks There are quacks who dont treat and quacks who
treat Ones that refuse to diagnose and ones that diagnose improperly 
There are lucky quacks and unlucky quacks Smart quacks and dumb ones 

There are people ahead of their time with unprobable or unproven theories
and rationals There are illreasoned absurd theorists 

Sometimes its hard to tell whos who  

Reading a book of ancient jokes it seems that doctors called other doctors
quacks in Babylon 

Arguments abound when there arent any firm answers Plenty of illnesses
arent or cant be diagnosed or treated But I think its better to argue
against the theory as was originally done with postings on candida a month
or so ago Stating the facts usually works better than simply asserting an
opinion about someones competency And you cant convince everybody 

Sometimes a correct diagnosis
takes years for people they dont run into a doctor who recognizes the
disease they havent developed something recognizable yet or they have
something that no one is going to recognize because it hasnt been
described yet Sometimes they get a cure sometimes the illness wears out
sometimes they stumble on an improper diagnosis with the right treatment
sometimes they find its incurable  

There is no profit in a patient accepting a hopeless attitude about an 
illness Unless its a rock solid diagnosis of terminal disease its is
more like ly that a person will find a cure if they keep looking
