Do you believe that any quacks exist  How about quack diagnoses  Is
being a licensed physician enough to guarantee that someone is not
a quack or is it just that even if a licensed physician is a quack
other people shouldnt say so

I would say there are also significant numbers of unscrupulous doctors of
the squeakyclean traditional crewcut talk to the AMA before starting
any treatment kind

Umm werent you the one objecting to someone who is a licensed
physician being called a quack  Or is it just that being a licensed
physician is a good defense against charges of quackery when the
physician agrees with your system of beliefs

Lately Ive seen the word quack bandied about recklessly

Actually I almost never use the term quack  When I discuss
systemic yeast syndrome however I always point out that
mainstream medicine views this as a quack diagnosis and I agree
with that characterization

Let me put it another way to make my point clear  quack is a nebulous word
lacking in any precision

Really  I bet virtually everyone reading these posts understands what
Steve Dyer Gordon Banks and I am implying when we have talked about
systemic yeast syndrome as a quack diagnosis  Would you prefer the
word charlatan  I dont happen to think that all quacks are
charlatans since I suspect that some believe in the diseases they
are diagnosing

ps may I suggest  seriously  that if the doctors and wannabedoctors on
the net who refuse to have an open mind on alternative treatments and
theories such as the yeast theory should create your own moderated group

Why  Is there some reason why you feel that it shouldnt be pointed out
in SCImed that there is no convincing empirical evidence to support the 
existence of systemic yeast syndrome
