poster for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did 
not exist  Calling this physician a quack was reprehensible Steve and I 
see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well  
 
 Do you believe that any quacks exist  How about quack diagnoses  Is
 being a licensed physician enough to guarantee that someone is not
 a quack or is it just that even if a licensed physician is a quack
 other people shouldnt say so  Can you give an example of a
 commonly diagnosed ailment that you think is a quack diagnosis
 or have we gotten to the point in civilization where we no longer
 need to worry about unscrupulous healers taking advantage of
 people

I dont like the term quack being applied to a licensed physician David
Questionable conduct is more appropriately called unethicalin my opinion
Ill give you some examples

	1 Prescribing controlled substances to patients with no 
	   demonstrated needother than a drug addition for the medication

	2 Prescribing thyroid preps for patients with normal thyroid 
	   function for the purpose of quick weight loss

	3 Using laetril to treat cancer patients when such treatment has 
	   been shown to be ineffective and dangerouscyanide release by 
	   the NCI

These are errors of commission that competently trained physicians should 
not committ but sometimes do  There are also errors of omissionsome of 
which result in malpractice suits  I dont think that using antifungal 
agents to try to relieve discomfort in a patient who you suspect may be 
having a problem with candidaor another fungal growth is an error of 
commission or omission  Healers have had a long history of trying to 
relieve human suffering  Some have stuck to standard approved procedures
others have been willing to try any reasonable treatment if there is a 
chance that it will help the patient  The key has to be tied to the 
healers oath I will do no harm  But you know David that very few 
treatments involve no risk to the patient  The job of the physician is a 
very difficult one when risk versus benefit has to be weighed  Each 
physician deals with this riskbenefit paradox a little differently  Some 
are very conservative while others are more agressive  An agressive 
approach may be more costly to the patient and carry more risk but as long 
as the motive is improving the patients health and not an attempt to rake 
in lots of moneythrough some of the schemes that have been uncovered in 
the medicare fraud cases I dont see the need to label these healers as 
quacks or even unethical

What do I reserve the term quack for  Pseudomedical professionals  
These people lurk on the fringes of the health care system waiting for the 
frustrated patient to fall into their lair  Some of these individuals are 
really doing a pretty good job of providing alternative medicine  But 
many lack any formal training and are in the business simply to make a 
few fast bucks   While a patient can be reasonably assured of getting 
competent care when a liscenced physician is consulted this alternative 
care area is really a buyers beware arena  If you are lucky you may find 
someone who can help you  If you are unlucky you can loose a lot of 
money and develop severe disease because of the inability of these pseudo
medical professional to diagnose diseasewhich is the fortay of the 
liscened physicians

I hope that this clears things up David
